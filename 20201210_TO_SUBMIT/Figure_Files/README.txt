Nature requires individual figure files for the final submission only

Illustrator .ai files are accepted for vector files:

from https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/final-submission

Nature preferred formats are:

Layered Photoshop (PSD) or TIFF format (high resolution, 300–600 dots per inch (dpi) for photographic images. In Photoshop, it is possible to create images with separate components on different layers. This is particularly useful for placing text labels or arrows over an image, as it allows them to be edited later. If you have done this, please send the Photoshop file (.psd) with the layers intact.
Adobe Illustrator (AI), Postscript, Vector EPS or PDF format for figures containing line drawings and graphs, including figures combining text and line art with photographs or scans.
If these formats are not possible, we can also accept the following formats: JPEG (high-resolution, 300–600 dpi), CorelDraw (up to version 8), Microsoft Word, Excel or PowerPoint.

Please do not send the following formats, as we cannot use them for print-quality reproduction: Canvas, DeltaGraph, Tex, ChemDraw, SigmaPlot. These files should be converted to postscript, EPS or PDF format before submission.
