#### this code makes the filtered_correlations
### it looks for array genes that have significant genetic itneractions with at least one of the Gsp1 mutants
### and then keeps only those spitzemapko queries that have siginificant interactions with at least 10 of these queries
### the point is to only consider pearson correlations that are based on some signal
## it removes all the weak queries and Gsp1 mutants, because they give arificially high correlations
### This filtered correlations output is the basis for all the analysis in the clustering_by_corr directory

### TLD;DR 
### This code outputs two variations of filtered correlations:
### both keep only the queries that have at least 10 siginificant interactions (outside of the -3/+3 limits) with array genes that have significant interactions with Gsp1 mutants
### 1) corr_of_corr_with_SGA/filtered_v5_correlations.RData keeps only the queries that have at least 1 siginificant correlation according to Bonfferoni (n = 476)
### 2) corr_of_corr_with_SGA/filtered_v6_correlations.RData keeps only the queries that have at least 1 siginificant correlation according to Bonfferoni (n = 278)
