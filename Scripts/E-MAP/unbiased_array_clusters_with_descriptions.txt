YPT7	1198	YML001W	Rab family GTPase; GTP-binding protein of the rab family; required for homotypic fusion event in vacuole inheritance, for endosome-endosome fusion; localizes to sites of contact between the vacuole and mitochondria (vCLAMPs); interacts with the cargo selection/retromer complex for retrograde sorting; similar to mammalian Rab7	Yeast Protein Two
YSY6	1199	YBR162W-A	Protein of unknown function; expression suppresses a secretory pathway mutation in E. coli; has similarity to the mammalian RAMP4 protein involved in secretion	NA
YTA7	1200	YGR270W	Protein that localizes to chromatin; has a role in regulation of histone gene expression; has a bromodomain-like region that interacts with the N-terminal tail of histone H3, and an ATPase domain; relocalizes to the cytosol in response to hypoxia; potentially phosphorylated by Cdc28p	Yeast Tat-binding Analog
YUR1	32	YJL139C	Mannosyltransferase involved in protein N-glycosylation; member of the KTR1 family; located in the Golgi apparatus; YUR1 has a paralog, KTR2, that arose from the whole genome duplication	Yeast Unknown Reading frame
ZDS1	337	YMR273C	Protein with a role in regulating Swe1p-dependent polarized growth; involved in maintaining Cdc55p in the cytoplasm where it promotes mitotic entry; involved in mitotic exit through Cdc14p regulation; interacts with silencing proteins at telomeres; has a role in Bcy1p localization; implicated in mRNA nuclear export; ZDS1 has a paralog, ZDS2, that arose from the whole genome duplication	Zillion Different Screens
ZRT1	715	YGL255W	High-affinity zinc transporter of the plasma membrane; responsible for the majority of zinc uptake; transcription is induced under low-zinc conditions by the Zap1p transcription factor	Zinc-Regulated Transporter
