tcd1	TCD1	5	pos_with_GEF	tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine dehydratase; required for the ct6A tRNA base modification, where an adenosine at position 37 is modified to form a cyclized active ester with an oxazolone ring; localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane; TCD1 has a paralog, TCD2, that arose from the whole genome duplication
tcd2	TCD2	5	pos_with_GEF	tRNA threonylcarbamoyladenosine dehydratase; required for the ct6A tRNA base modification, where an adenosine at position 37 is modified to form a cyclized active ester with an oxazolone ring; localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane; TCD2 has a paralog, TCD1, that arose from the whole genome duplication
tdp1	TDP1	5	pos_with_GEF	Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase I; hydrolyzes 3' and 5'-phosphotyrosyl bonds; involved in the repair of DNA lesions created by topo I and topo II; mutations in the human homolog, TDP1, result in the a neurodegenerative disease, spinocerebellar ataxia with axonal neuropathy (SCAN1); yeast cells and human rhabdomyosarcoma lines that overexpress TDP1 both exhibit elevated dosage chromosomal instability (dCIN)
tim50-5001	TIM50	1	pos_with_GEF	Essential component of the TIM23 complex; acts as receptor for the translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane (TIM23) complex guiding incoming precursors from the TOM complex; may control the gating of the Tim23p-Tim17p channel
tim54-5001	TIM54	1	pos_with_GEF	Component of the mitochondrial TIM22 complex; involved in insertion of polytopic proteins into the inner membrane
ubr2	UBR2	1	pos_with_GEF	Cytoplasmic ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3); component of the Mub1p-Ubr2p-Rad6p ubiquitin ligase complex required for the ubiquitination and degradation of Rpn4p; mediates formation of the ternary complex
ura7	URA7	5	pos_with_GEF	Major CTP synthase isozyme (see also URA8); catalyzes the ATP-dependent transfer of the amide nitrogen from glutamine to UTP, forming CTP, the final step in de novo biosynthesis of pyrimidines; involved in phospholipid biosynthesis; capable of forming cytoplasmic filaments termed cytoophidium, especially during conditions of glucose depletion; URA7 has a paralog, URA8, that arose from the whole genome duplication
